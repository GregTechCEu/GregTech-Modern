   Gas collectors collect gases from the surrounding environment. The air collection speed has nothing to do with whether there are blocks around it. In the non-overclocked state, it is fixed at 10,000 L of air every 10 seconds.

   The gas generated by the gas collector operating in different dimensions is inconsistent. Running in the Overworld will generate air (requires LV level voltage); running in the Nether will generate nether air (requiring MV level voltage); and running in the End will generate end air (requiring HV level voltage). Operation requires programming circuitry to configure the types of gases it collects.
