  <text>Staying in line with the base game, ores in GT Modern no longer drop their block when mined and instead drop raw ore, these raw ores can be processed exactly as the blocks were processed in 1.12.2, but avoid the issue of having multiple different stone types of the same or clogging up the inventory. These raw ores can be compressed into raw ore blocks for more compact storage.</text>
