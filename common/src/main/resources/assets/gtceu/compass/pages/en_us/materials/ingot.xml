  <text>Ingots are the most basic form of material, their primary purpose is to be transformed into the other, more useful material components listed in this section. Ingots can be produced by either smelting a dust in a furnace or blast furnace, some of these ingots will produce a hot ingot when smelted and need cooling before they're usable, see the <style color="0xafff00" hover-info="click link" link="gtceu:materials/hot_ingot" underlined="true">Hot Ingot</style> page for more info.</text>
  <text>Materials, and thus ingots, come in, with some exceptions, two flavours, elemental materials and alloys. Where elemental materials are obtained from ore processing (ex. copper, tin) and possibly a few additional steps (ex. titanium, tungsten), alloys are mixtures of elemental materials. The mixing of these materials can be done manually for some earlygame materials in a crafting grid, where anything after that usually requires a mixer for mixing dusts. At EV the <style color="0xafff00" hover-info="click link" link="gtceu:multiblock/alloy_blast_furnace" underlined="true">Alloy Blast Furnace</style> becomes available as an alternative way for making alloys.</text>

  <!-- Materials can be classified by the energy tier at which they can be smelted, the machine they need (furnace, EBF, EBF + Vacuum Freezer), and the type of inert gas  -->
  <!-- that can be used when smelting, below is a list of materials and these properties. -->
